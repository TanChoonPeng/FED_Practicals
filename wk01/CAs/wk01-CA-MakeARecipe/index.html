      This is our entry for Jamie Oliver’s Search for a Food Tube Star with
      Uncle Ben’s competition. If you’re a Singaporean, there’s NO CHANCE that
      you wouldn’t know our iconic dish – Chicken Rice.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all know that Gordon Ramsay came to Singapore a couple weeks back to
      compete with our local hawkers, and this dish being one of the competing
      dishes, became our inspiration to pay tribute to the man himself. ????
    </p>
    <p>
      With all the days of research done on the ultimate chicken rice, this is
      our tribute, done THE F WORD STYLE, to Gordon Ramsay. Enjoy

      <li>
        Cook your own stock: 2 kilograms chicken carcasses, cover with cold
        water. Bring it up to a boil and simmer for 4 hours. Add water when
        neccessary. (or just buy pre-packed chicken stock)
      </li>
      <li>
        Brine chicken: ⅓ cup kosher salt and enough water to cover the chicken
      </li>
      <li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h4>Chicken</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        boil a pot of water or stock add in ½ knob ginger, 1 bunch spring onion
        and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        when the stock is boiling hold chicken by the neck and ladle hot soup on
        it, until the skin looks cooked for around 10 mins. then plunge whole
        chicken inside water (thigh side down) and put back lid on.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring it up to a boil then lid off and turn down heat to simmer for
        another 10 minutes. Next, lid on, GAS OFF and cook for 45 minutes.
        (cooking this way is akin to using the sous vide method. It makes the
        chicken so moist and tender)
      </li>
      <li>
        after 45 mins soak the whole chicken in a bowl of ice water for 15
        minutes (This step is CRUCIAL to stop the cooking process and to get the
        jelly under the chicken skin)
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Rice</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Wash and drain 600 grams of Thai Jasmine rice, fry up a blub of
        garlic(peeled and bashed) and ½ a knob of ginger(thick slices) in 6 tbsp
        of chicken oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the aromatic mix, and 800 ml of chicken stock to the rice. Plus a
        bunch of Pandan leaves, a big pinch of salt (to taste) and turn on the
        rice cooker.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the rice is cooked remove the aromatics and give the rice a good
        fluff.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Chili Sauce</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Peel a knob of ginger thumb size, smash half a bulb of garlic, add 6
        normal chilies and 4 chili padi (amount can be adjusted add more chili
        padi if your like your chili sauce hot), squeeze a quarter cup of lime
        juice put them all in the blender, season with salt and blend them all
        together.
      </li>
    </ol>
    To Serve
    <p>
      Chop the chicken up and lay it on a bed of cucumber, pour the dressing on
      top and a bunch of coriander. Serve up the chicken with the steam rice and
      chili sauce, there you have it your own homemade Hainanese chicken rice.
