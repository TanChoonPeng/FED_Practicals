Positioned elements follow a stacking order that determines which elements display above or below other elements. 

The z-index property is directly related to stacking order and it's what prevents elements from overlapping other elements.

An element with a higher z-index value overlaps an element with a lower z-index value.

Positioned elements have a z-index of 0 by default.

*z-index works only on elements with a position property set to absolute, fixed, or relative.If you set a z-index on an element with no position, it will do nothing.*
